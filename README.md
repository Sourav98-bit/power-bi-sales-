## Technical Implementation Notes

### Data Relationships
- Primary key: Likely order ID or product ID
- Relationships between:

### DAX Measures Likely Used
1. Basic aggregations:

   2. Ratio calculations:
   DAX
   Profit Margin = DIVIDE([Total Profit], [Total Sales])
   

3. Filter context measures:
   DAX
   Sales by Product = CALCULATE([Total Sales], FILTER(...)).
    ## Slicer Enhancements:
   - Add hierarchy slicers (year → quarter → month)

     ## KPI Formatting:
   - Add comparison indicators (▲/▼ vs previous period)
   - Include progress bars against targets

   ## Advanced Interactivity:
   - Cross-filtering between charts
   - Drill-through capabilities
